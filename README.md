# 👋 Hi, I'm Sajeevan

I'm a **developer** and **security researcher** passionate about building secure, scalable systems. I work across the stack—from full-stack web applications and blockchain protocols to CLI tools and low-level utilities. I love working with Rust, Go, Ruby, and modern web technologies like React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
